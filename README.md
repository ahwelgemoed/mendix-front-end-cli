  **This is the most important part and ensure you get it right**

  Add the following lines to your `$HOME/.bash_profile` or `$HOME/.bashrc` (if you are using zsh then `~/.zprofile` or `~/.zshrc`) config file

  ```
  export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
  export PATH="${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk/tools:${HOME}/Library/Android/sdk/pl$
  export ANDROID_SDK=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
  export PATH=$ANDROID_SDK/emulator:$ANDROID_SDK/tools:$PATH
